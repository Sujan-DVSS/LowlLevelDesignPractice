A curated, growing collection of **Low Level Design (LLD)** / **Object-Oriented Design (OOD)** practice problems and implementations — focused on writing **clean**, **extensible**, and **interview-ready** code.

If you’re preparing for **LLD / Machine Coding rounds**, this repo is meant to be:
- A structured place to practice **requirements → design → code**
- A reference for **design patterns + SOLID** in real problem statements
- A community space where others can **add problems/solutions/reviews**
